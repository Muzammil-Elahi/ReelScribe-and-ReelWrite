## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Input the URL of the IG Reel**:  
   Paste the URL of the Instagram Reel into the application.

2. **Download the Video**:  
   The tool uses **Instaloader** to fetch and download the video from Instagram.

3. **Generate a Transcript**:  
   The downloaded video is processed using **Assembly AI**, which generates an accurate transcript of the content.

4. **Rewrite the Transcript**:  
   Using **ChatGPT**, the raw transcript is rephrased into an engaging, professionally written script following this predefined format:
   - **Hook**
   - **Describe the Problem**
   - **Present the Solution**
   - **Provide Examples or More Details**
   - **Call to Action**

5. **Save the Script to Google Docs**:  
   The rewritten script is automatically exported to Google Docs for easy access, collaboration, and future use.
